        <h1>H1: LION</h1>
          <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 
            It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
            It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 
            It is a social species, forming groups called prides. </p><br>

        <h2>H2: TIGER</h2> 
          <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
            It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. 
            An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. 
            It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.</p><br>

        <h3>H3: CHEETAH</h3>
          <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. 
            Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. 
            It reaches 67-94 cm (26-37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in).</p><br>

        <h4>H4: ELEPHANT</h4>  
          <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals. 
            Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). 
            They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.</p><br>

        <h5>H5: BEAR</h5> 
          <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. 
            They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. 
            Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. </p><br>

        <h6>H6: GIRAFFE</h6> 
          <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
            It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
            Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. 
            Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. </p><br>
